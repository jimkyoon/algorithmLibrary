# algorithmLibrary
Hello world and welcome to my algorithm library!

This is a repository of all the alogrithms I have encountered, worked on, and practiced.

These are all written in JavaScript and have used most of the Airbnb JavaScript style guide (ESLint). 

The algorithms I have worked on are from various places. Some are from coding challenge sites like LeetCode, Coderbyte and Codewars. Some are from books, online tutorials, and workshops. 
But they are all algorithms that I have worked on and practiced. Some are even refactored when I revisit them!

This repository will constantly be updated every time I finish an algorithm!
